# NumPy Project - Students’ Marks Analysis
This NumPy Project analyses the marks scored out of 100 by 50 students in 3 subjects. This Analysis involves pass/fail metrics, count of students on different criteria, student and subjects based analysis, highest/lowest scores etc.

## FEATURES INVOLVED

### STUDENT-WISE ANALYSIS

-Total marks of each student

-Average marks scored by each student.

-Highest and Lowest marks scored by each student.

### SUBJECT-WISE ANALYSIS

-Average marks scored in each subject.

-Maximum and Minimum marks scored in each subject.

-No. of students scored less than 20 in maths.

### COUNT OF STUDENTS 

-No. of students with more than 90 marks.

-No. of students who passed all exams.

-No. of students who failed any exam.


### SELECTION OF STUDENTS ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA

-TOP 5 students of the class.

-Bottom 5 students of the class.


## TECHNOLOGY

-Python

-NumPy

-Jupyter Notebook

This project is based on only NumPy operations, no Pandas or Matplotlib  used

## WHY I BUILT THIS PROJECT

To practice NumPy indexing, iteration, mathematical operations, axis operations without Pandas.

## FUTURE IDEAS

-Add Visualisations

-Add students’ and subjects names
